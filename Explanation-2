1. Software
Definition:
Software refers to a collection of programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer what to do. It is intangible and exists in the form of code written in programming languages.

Types of Software:

System Software: Operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
Application Software: Word processors, web browsers, mobile apps
Embedded Software: Firmware in devices like microwaves, cars
Importance:
Software enables hardware to perform useful tasks. It is the core component that interacts with users and hardware resources to deliver functionalities.

2. Data
Definition:
Data is the raw information processed by software. It can take many forms—numbers, text, images, audio, video, etc.

Role in Software:

Data is inputted into programs for processing.
The output is often based on manipulated data.
Proper data management ensures accuracy, security, and efficiency.
Types of Data in Software:

Structured Data: Organized in tables (databases)
Unstructured Data: Free-form data like emails, videos
Semi-structured Data: XML, JSON formats
Data and Software Relationship:
Effective software relies on clean, well-organized data. The quality of data impacts the accuracy of results, decision-making, and system performance.

3. Design
Definition:
Design is the process of planning how a software system will function, how it will be built, and how it will meet user needs before actual coding begins.

Key Aspects of Design:

Requirement Analysis: Understanding what the software should do
System Design: Structuring the system components and their interactions
User Interface Design: Making the software usable and accessible
Database Design: Structuring how data will be stored and retrieved
Types of Design:

High-Level Design (Architectural Design): Overall system structure
Low-Level Design: Detailed component and module specifications
Importance:
Good design results in maintainable, scalable, efficient, and reliable software systems.

4. Architecture
Definition:
Software architecture refers to the high-level structure of a system, defining the main components, their interactions, and the technologies used.

Components of Software Architecture:

Modules/Components: Independent units performing specific functions
Interfaces: Points of communication between components
Data Flow: How data moves through the system
Control Flow: How processes interact and coordinate
Types of Architectures:

Monolithic: All components tightly integrated
Client-Server: Client applications interact with a central server
Layered Architecture: Divides system into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access)
Microservices: Small, independent services working together
Role:
Architecture influences system performance, scalability, security, and maintainability. It provides a blueprint for developers.

5. Algorithm
Definition:
An algorithm is a precise set of instructions or a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.

Characteristics of a Good Algorithm:

Well-Defined Inputs and Outputs
Finite Steps: It terminates after a certain number of steps
Efficiency: Uses resources (time, space) optimally
Correctness: Produces the correct output for all valid inputs
Examples of Algorithms:

Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
Search algorithms (Binary Search)
Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)
Machine learning
